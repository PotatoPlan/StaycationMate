# StaycationMate

Staycation Mate is a travel agency mock up web application allowing users to browse, book, and manage their trip within Victoria, Australia.

This web application is built with ASP.NET MVC and major programming languages are C# and JavaScript.

Several third-party APIs are utilised including SendGrid, MapBox, Google OAuth, and OpenWeatherMap API. Replace "USE YOUR OWN KEY" string with your own API keys from those API providers to make this application functioning.

This project is a part of university's assessments.
